              <h1>Marty Seamus McFly</h1>
              Martin Seamus McFly is a fictional character and the protagonist
              of the Back to the Future trilogy. He is portrayed by actor
              Michael J. Fox. McFly also appears in the animated series, where
              he was voiced by David Kaufman. In the videogame by Telltale
              Games, he is voiced by A. J. Locascio; in addition, Fox voiced
              McFly's future counterparts at the end of the game. In 2008,
              McFly was selected by Empire magazine as the 12th Greatest
              Movie Character of All Time.[1] He is also the inspiration
              for Morty Smith, the second main protagonist of Rick and Morty.

            <h1>Biography</h1>
            Marty was born in Hill Valley, California to the McFlys, a family of
            Irish descent. Little is known about Marty's life prior to the first
            Back to the Future film, except for the fact that he set fire to the
            living-room rug when he was 8 years old (in a statement of Marty's to
            his future parents).[2] He met his friend Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown when
            he was around fourteen after hearing that Brown was a dangerous
            lunatic. Marty, being the “red-blooded American teenager” he was,
            wanted to go see what it was all about for himself. He found Doc’s
            lab and was fascinated by all his inventions. When Doc caught him, he
            was glad to have someone who liked his work and their friendship
            started there

          <h1>Family</h1>
          Marty McFly is the youngest of three children of George McFly and
          Lorraine Baines-McFly. He has a brother, Dave McFly, and a sister,
          Linda McFly. In addition, he has an uncle, Joey, who is serving a prison
          sentence in 1985 and is denied parole.
          Marty's secondary entourage consists of girlfriend Jennifer Parker and best
          friend Emmett Brown, a scientist whom Marty and Jennifer call "Doc." There is
          an implication that Marty is ashamed of his family and does not spend much time
          at home, preferring to hang out with Doc, Jennifer, or the guys in his band,
          The Pinheads.[2] However, Marty's relationships with his family changed after
          he returns from 1955, with him no longer being alienated by his parents and
          his father working as a local college professor and a successful novelist in
          the alternate timeline he inadvertently created. Marty also meets his
          great-great paternal grandparents Seamus and Maggie, when he was stranded
          in 1885. He also meets their infant son William, Marty's great grandfather.
          Through his interaction with Seamus and Maggie, Marty discovers that Seamus
          had a brother named Martin, thus Marty's great-great granduncle.<br><br>
